# ZSH-JT-THEMES

This is a collection of my custom zsh themes (or customizations to existing themes) that I do not intend others to find useful.  I created these theme for 2 reasons.

1. I use the [Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd?hl=en) extension which many themes are not compatible with and cause cursor alignment issues.  If I found a theme I liked, I would copy the theme, credit the original author, and make the changes necessary to work with the Secure Shell extension.

1. I like a particular theme (or plugin) but want some custom colors (e.g. [jt-highlighting-custom.zsh](https://github.com/JtMotoX/zsh-jt-themes/blob/d7efc0384053e6e54ed3e3881bc8b70005049a69/jt-highlighting-custom.zsh))
